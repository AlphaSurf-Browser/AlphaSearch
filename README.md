# AlphaSearch

AlphaSearch is a simple and powerful search engine that allows users to crawl websites and store the results in a GitHub repository via a pull request. Powered by AlphaBot, this project enables developers to easily gather data from their sites and manage it with version control.

## Features

- **Website Crawling**: Crawl and gather information from websites.
- **GitHub Integration**: Automatically create a pull request to store crawl results in a GitHub repository.
- **Easy Setup**: Simple installation and configuration process.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v14 or higher)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (Node package manager)
- A GitHub account with a repository to store crawl results.
- A GitHub personal access token with the `repo` scope.

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your_username/AlphaSearch.git
   cd AlphaSearch
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Set up environment variables**:

   Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add the following lines:

   ```plaintext
   GITHUB_TOKEN=your_personal_access_token
   REPO_OWNER=your_github_username
   REPO_NAME=your_repository_name
   ```

   Replace `your_personal_access_token`, `your_github_username`, and `your_repository_name` with your actual values.

4. **Run the application**:

   Start the development server:

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

   Navigate to `http://localhost:3000` in your web browser.

## Usage

1. **Enter the URL**: In the input field, enter the URL of the website you want to crawl.
2. **Start the crawl**: Click the **"Start Crawl"** button to begin the crawling process.
3. **Check the results**: Once the crawl is complete, the results will be saved as a JSON file in your specified GitHub repository via a pull request.
